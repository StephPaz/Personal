# TMHP (Texas Medicaid Health Plan) Ambulance Policy 

## Transport Policy - Submitted on CMS-1500 Paper Claim Form

This engine has been created for the purpose of applying the policy set forth in the Texas Medicaid Provider Procedures Manual, Provider Handbooks Volume 2, Ambulance Services Handbook. This engine is the first in a bundle and is specific to the portion of the policy that pertains to professional, non-hospital owned ambulance provider claims that are required to be submitted on the CMS-1500 paper claim form only. It covers emergency vs. non-emergency transport, oxygen and disposable supplies policy, types of transport, extra attendent and ambulance claims coding. At present the engine does not cover policy relating to distance traveled or out-of-state transport. 

Associated engines will apply to the hospital owned and operated ambulance services which are required to be submitted electronically.  The final engine in the bundle will implement the portion of the policy pertaining to the "Payment Window Reimbursement Guidelines for Services Preceding an
Inpatient Admission."
