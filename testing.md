Explanation: This is a document labeled "Exhibit". It is generally the case that a document labeled this way is not a policy. If you read fruther you will find that this is an evaluation questionnaire that a managed care provider must fill out in order to maintain status as a managed care organization for Florida residents. Therefore this document does not qualify as any of the types of policy in question.

Explanation: This is an announcement by Pennsylvania Department of Human Services regarding the prior authorization policy surrounding proton pump inhibitors. Sometimes official policy updates can be communicated in bulletins. If a provider is required to have a prior authorization and does not get one, they won't be paid. That puts this into the Reimbursement Policy category. Lets take a look at the breakdown:  

   a. WHY - Updated handbook pages including prior authorization requirements for medical neccessity evaluation for proton pump inhibitors
   b. WHO - The bulletin applies to all licensed pharmacies and prescribers enrolled in the Medical Assistance Program who provide services in the fee-for-service system
   c. WHAT - Prior authorizations are required when: Prescriptions for drugs not on the preferred drug list (a reference document that is linked to in the bulletin), or when the quantity limit is exceeded, if it is being prescribed to a child under 6 years if the total duration of the prescription is longer than 4 months or more in the previous 180 day period (6 months)...and more.

 Explanation: This is a Clinical Guideline policy. It will often look quite different from a Reimbursement or Member Benefits policy type. While they don't typically refer to specific HCPCS or CPT procedure codes that would be used on a medical claim, they do refer to specific services with a rating as to whether it is clinically appropriate for the condition(s) that the patient suffers. The rating scale is defined in the document. 
 
   a. WHY - These criteria are intended to guide radiologists, radiation oncologists and referring physicians in making decisions regarding radiologic imaging and treatment.
   
   b. WHO - Any service provider who is providing radiologic imaging and treatment
   
   c. WHAT - Under various conditions listed in the tables, there is a rating accompanying each procedure which corresponds to the level of appropriateness for choosing that procedure.

 Explanation: This looks like simple Fee Schedule reference data, which is usually not the policy itself (but supports a payment policy). In some cases the fee schedule can also contain medical policy, like in this case where it also includes the number of units allowed as well as the modifiers that are allowed. It also includes information that for children under 21, there is a percentage increase in payment (with some exceptions who don't recieve increase and others who receive additional increase, also listed).

  - [x] No
  
Explanation: This is another fee schedule, but there is no additional policy listed - simply codes and fees. This is pure reference data and doesn't stand alone as policy without additional documentation.
