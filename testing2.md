We are working to automatically identify healthcare/medical policy content from healthcare related websites.

#### Qualification Test
A qualification test is required before working on these HITs and may be updated at any time. There is no tolerance of spamming. Your answers are compared to other answers which allow us to determine the accuracy of your work. If we later find that your performance is significantly lower than what you did in the qualification task and compared to other common questions, we retain the right to reject your HITs or block you from this work.

#### MTurk HIT
Read the pdf content presented in the MTurk HIT and select one of the policy classification answers:
  * Definitely
  * Probably
  * I am Not Sure
  * Probably Not
  * No

The content you review will either be medical policy or not, so you should always try to choose either "Definitely" or "No". We provide more choices than just "definitely" and "no" because we also want to know when something is very confusing. Some people might get the right answer and others will not. It is important that you are honest and that your answer reflects your confidence level. If you want, feel free to add a comment about your confusion in the "Feedback" section. Having this information helps us fine-tune our models. 

There are keywords in the document that may help identify whether certain medical policy _elements_ are likely to be present; however, a high number of keywords does not necessarily mean that the document is medical policy and likewise, a low number of keywords does not mean that the document is not a medical policy. If you want to 'jump' to the portion of a content with a keyword, copy the keyword then click into the content area of the page and use the find command (like Ctrl+F) and paste the keyword.

## What is Healthcare Policy?
<details>

In general, a "policy" is a set of rules that someone puts into place. These rules are meant to be followed by the people they are being written for. In our case, we are looking at rules written for people or places involved in _healthcare_, like for a hospital or a doctor or an ambulance service. Here are a few of the types of healthcare policies:

**Reimbursement Policies** - Rules in healthcare surrounding when a service/item will be paid, or how much will be paid. These policies apply to the professionals providing the service and are not dependent on the particular insurance policy coverage an individual has. Services can be supplying medical equipment, medical treatment, therapy, transportation and more. Providers are reimbursed by submitting a "claim" to a healthcare payor (such as Medicaid, Medicare, or a commercial insurance company).

**Benefits Policies** - Another type of rule might be about how many times a person can go to a doctor in a year, or if their health insurance covers therapy or certain types of prescription medicine. Maybe a rule is about how much a person has to pay of their own money when they get a service. These are all benefits policies based on an individual's specific insurance policy language/terms. These can be different from one person to the next.

**Clinical Guideline Policies** - These are policies/guidelines to help healthcare providers (like doctors and nurses) treat people who have different illnesses. They are typically describing appropriate treatments for various diseases and may include statements like "Strongly Recommended" or have a star-rating on the effectiveness of the treatment. Sometimes it is more difficult to tell by what is written if it is a healthcare policy, but they are almost all referred to as "clinical guidelines."

## How can you tell if it is a Heathcare or Medical Policy?
<details>

 <br/>
You can tell if something is "policy" if it says who it is a rule for and the result or outcome of the rule. Sometimes the rules can be complicated - when that happens, it is easier to tell if something is a policy by looking for the building blocks, or parts, of a policy to see if they are there.  If you find the key parts, then you probably have a policy.

## Parts of a Medical Policy
All policy should have all three of these components:

### Purpose Statement (The WHY)
 <details>
 <summary>
  Collapse/Expand
 </summary>
 <br/>
The purpose statement might be found at the beginning or the end of the content, but it will be more of an overview of why this policy is in place.  

One example is from the Medi-Cal California Medicaid policy for Anesthesia:
   > This section _is to assist providers in completing claims_ for anesthesia services. 
 
In the above case, the WHY of the policy "is to assist providers in completing claims". 
   Another example is from Humana and is a general statement that they put on all of their reimbursement policies:

   > This policy is made available _to provide information on certain Humana claims payment policies_.
</details>

### Scope Statement (The WHO)
<details>
 <summary>
  Collapse/Expand
 </summary>
 <br/>
The scope statement part of a policy is where the person making the rule states who the rule applies to (who the policy affects). Sometimes the WHY and the WHO might be mixed together.

Let's go back to the Medi-Cal California Medicaid policy for Anesthesia:

> This section is to assist _providers in completing claims for anesthesia services_. 
 
In the above example, the WHO is providers of anesthesia services.
A second example is from Aetna's published policy on Allergy Testing:

> Aetna considers specific allergy testing medically necessary _for members with clinically significant allergic history of symptoms_

While the Aetna policy is talking about medical necessity for members, meaning that it will only cover services under certain circumstances, the other WHO implied is the provider of those allergy testing services, even though they didn't say "providers of allergy testing". 
</details>

### Policy Statement(s) (The WHAT)
<details>
 <summary>
  Collapse/Expand
 </summary>
 <br/>
The Policy Statement is the part of the policy that explains the rule itself - it is the 'what'. This portion of the policy will talk about the requirements that must be followed - it is the essence of the rule or policy. Most of the time there are many policy statements (WHAT statements) in a policy or manual.  If you are reviewing a page and find even a single WHAT, you do not have to keep reviewing to find more (unless you aren't sure that it is policy and want to try to find a better example on the page).

Example: Texas Medicaid Ambulance Policy
> Providers must submit claims for emergency transport with the ET modifier on each procedure code submitted. 

These examples both state that the person submitting an insurance claim needs to follow a certain rule (WHAT). You don't need to understand anything about health insurance claims here, you can simply look for a statement that says to DO something under some condition.  It is like a formula "Do X when Y" or "If This, then That."
If we can rearrange the samples to fit this formula, then they are a policy statement.

Break it down:

Operator | Rule Text
--------- | -------------------------------
X | Use modifier ET on procedure code
WHEN |
Y | Submit claim for emergency transport

That could also read "IF you want to submit a claim for emergency transport, THEN you need to use modifer ET on the procedure code."
