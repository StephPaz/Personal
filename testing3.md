## Definitely Policy Examples
In these examples you will find all three required parts of a healthcare/medical policy.  You will also find very specific values or "contextual reference data", like CPT, HCPCS, indicators or other values.  In the below examples these would be "A4224", "1 per week", "Indicator = "0", or the specific list of supporting documents.

Additionally you will find full examples of provider reimbursement policy, member benefit policy, and clinical guideline policy.

   a. WHY: Contains a list of frequency limits

   b. WHO: _**Any provider billing the procedure code** within the time frames_

   c. WHAT: **IF** _HCPCS Code_ **THEN** _Frequency Limit_ (If a provider bills A4224, they cannot bill more than 1 per week).

This policy in this example is a **Member Benefit policy**. It differs from provider reimbursement in that the limit is on the number of times a member can receive the service and be covered by the insurance, rather than limiting how many times a provider will be reimbursed for a given service.  The difference is sometimes subtle, but in essence a member benefit can be different between different members if they have different plans (such as a premium versus a basic plan) whereas the limit of reimbursements to a provider for a given code can be independent of a member's plan allowance.

   a. WHY: Information on change to benefit criteria for respiratory equipment

   b. WHO: _**Texas Medicaid Members**_

   c. WHAT: There are a few in this example:

1. **IF** _member needs A4606 with U5 modifier_ **THEN** _the service is covered for 1 per 6 calendar months_

2. **IF** _member needs A4623 with U3 modifier_ **THEN** _the plan will cover 31 units per calendar month without a prior approval_

3. **IF** _member needs A7025_ **THEN** _the plan will cover the service once per lifetime_
