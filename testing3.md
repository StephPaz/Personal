## Not Policy
Policy absolutely must have a WHAT.  This is because the WHAT portion of the policy is the rule.  If we don't have that then there is nothing we can enforce. There is nothing in particular a person has to do - no IF-THEN statement.
### Example 1

![Example 1 - NOT Policy](../images/NotPolicy.PNG)

a. WHY:
_"ABCs" of the Medi-Cal provider manuals contain the basic information about how your set of manuals works together...The provider manual is your primary billing reference_

b. WHO: this could only be a person who is reading it, maybe a person who bills the Medi-Cal program

c. WHAT: There are no WHATs - meaning, there are no rules on this content page.

### Example 2

  </summary>
<br/>
  
![Example 2 - NOT Policy](../images/NotPolicy_2.png)

a. WHY:
_Workaround for failing eligibility inquiries_

b. WHO: _Providers trying to determine patient eligibility_

c. WHAT: The workaround is simply a workflow method, not a healthcare policy. You might be tempted to think that this is a policy because you can say **IF** _a provider needs to check patient eligibility_ **THEN** _they cannot use client's first name in the field but a Medicaid ID + one of 3 additional identifiers._ But you need to look at the overall intent of the content (often in the title area). Ultimately this is simply a communication of information and does not constitute provider reimbursement policy, member benefit policy, or clinical guideline policy.

[Table of Contents Provider Manual](00b_table_of_contents.a3ebe84308d78989acdf461adf3d5d1a.pdf)
- A table of contents can sometimes look like the beginning of a manual with many healthcare policies but sometimes, like in this case, the document is ONLY the table of contents and there is no healthcare policy content.
